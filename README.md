Part I is a multiclassification project analyzing biometric data in a time series and predicts human activity using hybrid neural network model construction. 
Part II is a binary classification project predicting positivity/negativity of yelp reviews based on language content.
Both projects require vectorizing the data into numerical representation using NumPy.
